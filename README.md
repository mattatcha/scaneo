[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/variadico/scaneo/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/variadico/scaneo?branch=master)

Generate Go code to convert database rows into arbitrary structs.
Works with any database driver. Don't have to worry about database columns
and struct names matching or tagging structs. No ORM magic.

## Installation
Install or upgrade Scaneo with this command.
```
go get -u github.com/variadico/scaneo
```

Otherwise, check out the 
[releases page](https://github.com/variadico/scaneo/releases/latest).

## Usage
```
scaneo [options] paths...
```

### Options
```
-o, -output
    Set the name of the generated file. Default is scans.go.

-p, -package
    Set the package name for the generated file. Default is current
    directory name.

-u, -unexport
    Generate unexported functions. Default is export all.

-w, -whitelist
    Only include structs specified in case-sensitive, comma-delimited
    string.

-v, -version
    Print version and exit.

-h, -help
    Print help and exit.
```

## 3-Step Tutorial
First, we start with a file that looks like this, called `tables.go`.
```go
package models

import (
	"time"

	"github.com/lib/pq"
)

type Post struct {
	ID        int
	Created   time.Time
	Published pq.NullTime
	Draft     bool
	Title     string
	Body      string
}
```

Second, run `scaneo tables.go`. This will create a new file called `scans.go`,
which looks like this.
```go
// DON'T EDIT *** generated by scaneo *** DON'T EDIT //

package models

import "database/sql"

func ScanPost(r *sql.Row) (Post, error) {
	var s Post
	if err := r.Scan(
		&s.ID,
		&s.Created,
		&s.Published,
		&s.Draft,
		&s.Title,
		&s.Body,
	); err != nil {
		return Post{}, err
	}
	return s, nil
}
func ScanPosts(rs *sql.Rows) ([]Post, error) {
	structs := make([]Post, 0, 16)
	var err error
	for rs.Next() {
		var s Post
		if err = rs.Scan(
			&s.ID,
			&s.Created,
			&s.Published,
			&s.Draft,
			&s.Title,
			&s.Body,
		); err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		structs = append(structs, s)
	}
	return structs, nil
}
```

Third, call those functions from other parts of your code, like this.
```go
func serveHome(resp http.ResponseWriter, req *http.Request) {
	rows, err := db.Query("select * from post")
	if err != nil {
		log.Println(err)
		return
	}

	posts, err := models.ScanPosts(rows) // ScanPosts was auto-generated!
	if err != nil {
		log.Println(err)
	}

	// ... send posts to template or whatever...
}
```

### Go Generate
If you want to use `scaneo` with `go generate`, then just add this comment to
the top of `tables.go`.
```go
//go:generate scaneo $GOFILE

package models
// ... rest of code...
```

Now you can call `go generate` in `package models` and `scans.go` will be
created.

## FAQ
**Why did you write this instead of using sqlx, modl, gorm, gorp, etc?**

1. Didn't know which one I should learn. Already knew `database/sql`.
2. All I wanted was structs from the database.
3. I can write SQL.

In addition, I wasn't entirely sure how much more convenient an ORM would be in
contrast to writing the SQL myself. After reading some usage examples, it kind
of felt like I was writing SQL anyway.
```
// github.com/go-gorp/gorp
dbMap.Select(&users, "SELECT * FROM users WHERE last_name = ? OR age < ? ORDER BY age DESC LIMIT 2", "Doe", 12)

// github.com/eaigner/hood
hd.Where("last_name", "=", "Doe").Or("age", "<", 12).OrderBy("age").Limit(2).Find(&users)

// github.com/jmoiron/sqlx
db.Select(&people, "SELECT * FROM person ORDER BY first_name ASC")

// github.com/astaxie/beedb
orm.Where("last_name = ? OR age < ?", "Doe", 12).Limit(2).OrderBy("age").FindAll(&users)
```

**Do my table columns have to match my struct field names?**

Nope. The names don't actually matter at all. However, what *does* matter is
the order in which you declare the types in your struct. *That* has to match
the database table. So if your table looks like this:

```
 user_id | first_name | last_name
---------+------------+-----------
       1 | Silvio     | Rodríguez
```

then, your struct field names **must** follow the same order, like this.

```go
type User struct {
	ID        int
	FirstName string
	LastName  string
}
```
